# Human variation workflow

SNV, SV and CNV calling, modified base calling, and STR genotyping of human samples.



## Introduction

This repository contains a [nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) workflow
for analysing variation in human genomic data. Specifically this workflow can
perform the following:

* diploid variant calling
* structural variant calling
* analysis of modified base calls
* copy number variant calling
* short tandem repeat (STR) expansion genotyping

The wf-human-variation workflow consolidates the small variant calling from the previous wf-human-snp, structural variant calling from wf-human-sv, CNV calling from wf-cnv (all of which are now deprecated), as well as performing STR expansion genotyping.
This pipeline performs the steps of the four pipelines simultaneously and the results are generated and output in the same
way as they would have been had the pipelines been run separately.




## Compute requirements

Recommended requirements:

+ CPUs = 32
+ Memory = 128GB

Minimum requirements:

+ CPUs = 12
+ Memory = 32GB

Approximate run time: Variable depending on whether it is targeted sequencing or whole genome sequencing, as well as coverage and the individual analyses requested. For instance, a 90X human sample run (options: `--snp --sv --mod --str --cnv --phased_vcf --joint_phasing --phase_mod --sex male`) takes less than 8h with recommended resources.

ARM processor support: False




## Install and run

These are instructions to install and run the workflow on command line. You can also access the workflow via the [EPI2ME application](https://labs.epi2me.io/downloads/).  

The workflow uses [nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) to manage compute and software resources, therefore nextflow will need to be installed before attempting to run the workflow. 

The workflow can currently be run using either [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) or [singularity](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/index.html) to provide isolation of the required software.
Both methods are automated out-of-the-box provided either docker or singularity is installed.
This is controlled by the [`-profile`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/config.html#config-profiles) parameter as exemplified in the example below. 

It is not required to clone or download the git repository in order to run the workflow. 
More information on running EPI2ME workflows can be found on our [website](https://labs.epi2me.io/wfindex).

The following command can be used to obtain the workflow.
This  will pull the repository in to the assets folder of nextflow and provide a list of all parameters available for the workflow as well as an example command:

```
nextflow run epi2me-labs/wf-human-variation â€“help 
```
A demo dataset is provided for testing of the workflow. It can be downloaded using: 
```
wget https://ont-exd-int-s3-euwst1-epi2me-labs.s3.amazonaws.com/wf-human-variation/wf-human-variation-demo.tar.gz 
tar -xzvf wf-human-variation-demo.tar.gz
```
The workflow can be run with the demo data using: 
```
nextflow run epi2me-labs/wf-human-variation \ 
            --bam 'wf-human-variation-demo/demo.bam' \
            --basecaller_cfg 'clair3:dna_r10.4.1_e8.2_400bps_hac_prom' \
            --mod \
            --ref 'wf-human-variation-demo/demo.fasta' \
            --sample_name 'DEMO' \
            --snp \
            --sv \
            -profile standard 
```

## Input parameters

### Workflow Options

| Nextflow parameter name  | Type | Description | Help | Default |
|--------------------------|------|-------------|------|---------|
| sv | boolean | Call for structural variants. | If this option is selected, structural variant calling will be carried out using Sniffles2. | False |
| snp | boolean | Call for small variants | If this option is selected, small variant calling will be carried out using Clair3. | False |
| cnv | boolean | Call for copy number variants. | If this option is selected, copy number variant calling will be carried out using QDNAseq. | False |
| str | boolean | Enable Straglr to genotype STR expansions. | If this option is selected, genotyping of STR expansions will be carried out using Straglr. This sub-workflow is only compatible with genome build 38. | False |
| mod | boolean | Enable output of modified calls to a bedMethyl file [requires input BAM with Ml and Mm tags] | This option is automatically selected and aggregation of modified calls with be carried out using modkit if Ml and Mm tags are found. Disable this option to prevent output of a bedMethyl file. | False |


### Main options

| Nextflow parameter name  | Type | Description | Help | Default |
|--------------------------|------|-------------|------|---------|
| sample_name | string | Sample name to be displayed in workflow outputs. |  | SAMPLE |
| bam | string | Path to a BAM (or CRAM) containing aligned or unaligned reads. | The workflow currently accepts a single BAM or CRAM file. |  |
| ref | string | Path to a reference FASTA file. | Reference against which to compare reads for variant calling. |  |
| old_ref | string | Reference FASTA file for CRAM input (only required if the CRAM requires realignment) | You do not need to provide this unless the workflow specifically asks you to. If your input CRAM headers do not match the metadata of the input reference, the workflow will assume you want to realign your reads to the new input reference. CRAM files are compressed using the reference, so the read sequences cannot be realigned without the old reference. |  |
| basecaller_cfg | string | Name of the model to use for selecting a small variant calling model. | Required for small variant calling. The basecaller configuration is used to automatically select the appropriate small variant calling model. The model list shows all models that are compatible for small variant calling with this workflow. You should select 'custom' to override the basecaller_cfg with clair3_model_path. | dna_r10.4.1_e8.2_400bps_sup@v4.1.0 |
| bam_min_coverage | number | Minimum read coverage required to run analysis. |  | 20 |
| bed | string | An optional BED file enumerating regions to process for variant calling. |  |  |
| annotation | boolean | SnpEff annotation. | If this option is unselected, VCFs will not be annotated with SnpEff. | True |
| phased | boolean | Perform phasing. | This option enables phasing of SV, SNP and modifications, depending on which sub-workflow has been chosen; see [README](README.md#9-phasing-variants) for more details. | False |

### Structural variant calling options

| Nextflow parameter name  | Type | Description | Help | Default |
|--------------------------|------|-------------|------|---------|
| tr_bed | string | Input BED file containing tandem repeat annotations for the reference genome. | Providing a tandem repeat BED can improve calling in repetitive regions. An appropriate tandem repeat BED can be downloaded for your reference genome [from the Sniffles2 repository](https://github.com/fritzsedlazeck/Sniffles/tree/master/annotations). |  |


### Structural variant benchmarking options

| Nextflow parameter name  | Type | Description | Help | Default |
|--------------------------|------|-------------|------|---------|
| sv_benchmark | boolean | Benchmark called structural variants. | If this option is selected, automated benchmarking of structural variant calls will be carried out using Truvari. | False |


### Small variant calling options

| Nextflow parameter name  | Type | Description | Help | Default |
|--------------------------|------|-------------|------|---------|
| include_all_ctgs | boolean | Call for variants on all sequences in the reference, otherwise small variants will only be called on chr{1..22,X,Y}. | Enabling this option will call for variants on all contigs of the input reference sequence. Typically this option is not required as standard human reference sequences contain decoy and unplaced contigs that are usually omitted for the purpose of variant calling. This option might be useful for non-standard reference sequence databases. | False |


### Modified base calling options

By default this workflow outputs summary depth information from your aligned reads. Per-base depth outputs are slower to generate but may be required for some downstream applications. | False |
| GVCF | boolean | Enable to output a gVCF file in addition to the VCF outputs (experimental). | By default the the workflow outputs a VCF file containing only records where a variant has been detected. Enabling this option will output additionally a gVCF with records spanning all reference positions regardless of whether a variant was detected in the sample. | False |
| downsample_coverage | boolean | Downsample the coverage to along the genome. | This options will trigger a downsampling of the read alignments to the target coverage specified by --downsample_coverage_target. Downsampling will make the workflow run faster but could lead to non-deterministic variant calls. | False |
| downsample_coverage_target | number | Average coverage or reads to use for the analyses. | This options will set the target coverage for the downsampling stage, if downsampling has been enabled. | 60 |

## Pipeline overview

The workflow is composed of 6 distinct subworkflows, each enabled by a command line option:

* [SNP calling](#3-small-variant-calling-with-clair3): `--snp`
* [SV calling](#4-structural-variant-sv-calling-with-sniffles2): `--sv`
* [Analysis of modified bases](#5-modified-base-calling-with-modkit): `--mod`
* [CNV calling](#6-copy-number-variants-cnv-calling-with-qdnaseq): `--cnv`
* [STR genotyping](#7-short-tandem-repeat-str-genotyping-with-straglr): `--str`

Subworkflows where the relevant option is omitted will not be run.

### 1. Input and data preparation

The workflow relies on three primary input files:
1. A reference genome in [FASTA format](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/fastaformat/)
2. Sequencing data for the sample in the form of a single [BAM or CRAM file](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf), either aligned or unaligned.

The input BAM file can be generated using the [wf-basecalling](https://github.com/epi2me-labs/wf-basecalling/) workflow, which is up to date with the current dorado releases and models.

### 2. Data QC and pre-processing
The workflow starts by performing multiple checks of the input BAM file, as well as computing:
1. depth of sequencing with [mosdepth](https://github.com/brentp/mosdepth);
2. read alignment statistics with [fastcat](https://github.com/epi2me-labs/fastcat).

After computing the coverage, the workflow will check that the input BAM file has a depth greater than `--bam_min_coverage`.
In case the user specify `--bam_min_coverage 0`, the check will be skipped and the workflow will proceed directly to the downstream analyses.
Some components work better withing certain ranges of coverage, and the user might achieve better results by providing a target coverage to downsample to. The user can set `--downsample_coverage true` to enable the downsampling of the reads, and `--downsample_coverage_target {{ X }}` to specify the target coverage (default: 60x).

### 3. Small variant calling with Clair3

The workflow implements a deconstructed version of [Clair3](https://github.com/HKU-BAL/Clair3) (v1.0.4) to call germline variants. The appropriate model can be provided with the `--basecaller_cfg` option. To decide on the appropriate model you can check out the Dorado documentation for a list of available basecalling models.
This workflow takes advantage of the parallel nature of Nextflow, providing optimal efficiency in high-performance, distributed systems. The workflow will automatically call small variants (SNPs and indels), collect statistics, annotate them with [SnpEff](https://pcingola.github.io/SnpEff/) (and additionally for SNPs, ClinVar details), and create a report summarising the findings.

If desired, the workflow can perform phasing of structural variants by using the `--phased` option. This will lead the workflow to use [longphase](https://github.com/twolinin/longphase) to perform phasing of the variants, with the option to use [whatshap](https://whatshap.readthedocs.io/) instead by setting `--use_longphase false`. The phasing will also generate a GFF file with the annotation of the phase blocks, facilitating the detection of these within genome visualizers.

### 4. Structural variant (SV) calling with Sniffles2

The workflow allows for calling of SVs using long-read sequencing data with [Sniffles2](https://github.com/fritzsedlazeck/Sniffles).
The workflow will perform SV calling, filtering and generation of a report.
Optionally, the workflow can also evaluate calls on HG002 against a truth set (provided the input data was aligned to HG19).
The SV workflow takes an optional `--tr_bed` option to specify tandem repeats in the reference sequence --- see the [sniffles](https://github.com/fritzsedlazeck/Sniffles) documentation for more information.
SVs can be phased using `--phased`. However, this will cause the workflow to run SNP analysis, as SV phasing relies on the haplotagged reads generated in this stage.

### 5. Modified base calling with modkit

Modified base calling can be performed by specifying `--mod`. The workflow will call modified bases using [modkit](https://github.com/nanoporetech/modkit). 
The workflow will automatically check whether the files contain the appropriate `MM`/`ML` tags, required for running [modkit pileup](https://nanoporetech.github.io/modkit/intro_bedmethyl.html). If the tags are not found, the workflow will not run the individual analysis, but will still run the other subworkflows requested by the user.
The default behaviour of the workflow is to run modkit with the `--cpg --combine-strands` options set. It is possible to report strand-aware modifications by providing `--force_strand`, which will trigger modkit to run in default mode. The resulting bedMethyl will include modifications for each site on each strand separately.
The modkit run can be fully customized by providing `--modkit_args`. This will override any preset, and allow full control over the run of modkit.
Haplotype-resolved aggregated counts of modified bases can be obtained with the `--phased` option. This will generate three distinct BEDMethyl files with the naming pattern `{{ alias }}_{{ haplotype }}.wf_mods.bedmethyl.gz`, where `haplotype` can be `1`, `2` or `ungrouped`.

### 6. Copy number variants (CNV) calling with QDNASeq

CNV calling is performed using [QDNAseq](https://github.com/ccagc/QDNAseq). This workflow is compatible with genome builds hg19/GRCh37 or hg38/GRCh38.
In addition to the VCF of CNV calls, the workflow emits QDNAseq-generated plots and BED files of both raw read counts per bin and corrected, normalised, and smoothed read counts per bin.

### 7. Short tandem repeat (STR) genotyping with Straglr

STR genotyping is performed using a fork of [straglr](https://github.com/philres/straglr). This workflow is compatible with genome build hg38/GRCh38.
The STR workflow takes a required `--sex` option which is `male` or `female`. If `--sex` is not specified, the workflow will default to `female`. Please be aware that incorrect sex assignment will result in the wrong number of calls for all repeats on chrX.
In addition to a gzipped VCF file containing STRs found in the dataset, the workflow emits a TSV straglr output containing reads spanning STRs, and a haplotagged BAM. 

### 8. Phasing variants
The workflow can perform joint physical phasing with `longphase` of SNP, Indels and SVs by setting the `--phased --snp --sv` options.
The behaviour of the phasing is summarised in the below table:

|  |  |  |  | phased SNP VCF | phased SV VCF | Joint SV+SNP phased VCF | Phased bedMethyl |
|---------|--------|---------|------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| `--snp` | `--sv` | `--mod` | `--phased` |  |  | &check; | &check; |
| `--snp` | `--sv` |  | `--phased` |  |  | &check; |  |
| `--snp` |  |  | `--phased` | &check; |  |  |
|  | `--sv` |  | `--phased` |  | &check; |  |  |  |
|  |  | `--mod` | `--phased` |  |  |  | &check; |

In some circumstances, users may wish to keep the separate VCF files before joint phasing. This can be done with `--output_separate_phased`.

### 9. Variant annotation
Annotation will be performed automatically by the SNP and SV subworkflows, and can be disabled by the user with `--annotation false`. The workflow will annotate the variants using [SnpEff](https://pcingola.github.io/SnpEff/), and currently only support the human hg19 and hg38 genomes. Additionally, the workflow will add the [ClinVar](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/) annotations for the SNP variants.

Running the workflow on non-human samples will require this option to be disabled.




## Troubleshooting

+ Annotations for `--snp` and `--sv` are generated using [SnpEff](https://pcingola.github.io/SnpEff/). For `--snp`, additional [ClinVar](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/) annotations are displayed in the report where available (please note, the report will not display any variants classified as 'Benign' or 'Likely benign', however these variants will be present in the
output VCF).
+ Specifying a suitable [tandem repeat BED for your reference](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fritzsedlazeck/Sniffles/master/annotations/) with `--tr_bed` can improve the accuracy of SV calling.
+ Aggregation of modified calls with `--mod` requires data to be basecalled with a model that includes base modifications, providing the `MM` and `ML` BAM tags
+ CRAM files generated within the workflow cannot be read without the corresponding reference
+ The STR workflow performs genotyping of specific repeats, which can be found [here](https://github.com/epi2me-labs/wf-human-variation/blob/master/data/wf_str_repeats.bed).
+ While designed to work on human genomes, the workflow can be run on non-human species by setting `--cnv false --str false --annotation false`.
+ Ensure that the provided reference and BED files use the same chromosome coding (for example, that they both have the `chr` prefix, or they both to not have it).
+ If unaligned reads were provided, the workflow will output a CRAM file (or BAM if the user runs the `--cnv` option) containing the alignments used to make the downstream variant calls
